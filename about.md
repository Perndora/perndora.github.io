## Hi, I’m Somtochukwu Kingsley Onyeka

I am an aspiring technologist and data scientist driven by a strong desire to build real-world solutions with technology. I come from a marketing leadership background, where I’ve led teams and campaigns, and I am now fully committed to building advanced skills in software development, data analytics, and intelligent systems.

I am a graduate of the ALX Africa Data Science programme (powered by Explore AI Academy), with hands-on experience in Python, data analysis, Power BI, and data-driven problem solving. I thrive in challenging learning environments and enjoy breaking down complex concepts into practical, real-world applications.

My goal is to become a highly skilled tech professional who builds impactful products, contributes to innovative teams, and uses technology to solve meaningful problems in Africa and beyond.
